# ðŸ“± Used Phone Market Analysis â€“ Ghana

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes the economics of the used phone market in Ghana.  
It involves **scraping data** from local peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces, collecting **spare parts pricing**, and comparing these with **market resale prices** to understand profitability and trends.

The goal is to uncover insights into:
- How pricing varies across phone brands and models.
- Which phones hold their value best.
- The potential profit margins in refurbishing and reselling used phones.

This project is part of a practical data science study and will also be featured in a YouTube video exploring Ghanaâ€™s vibrant second-hand phone ecosystem.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Collect and clean data from online used phone listings.
- Gather data on spare part prices (screens, batteries, cameras, etc.).
- Compare listed prices with resale and part replacement costs.
- Analyze profit margins, depreciation, and market demand patterns.

## ðŸ”„ Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - Scrape used phone listings using Python (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, or `Selenium`).
   - Gather spare parts data manually or via scraping.
   - Store data in CSV or JSON format.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize brand/model names.
   - Normalize prices and filter unrealistic listings.

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Explore pricing distribution by brand, model, and condition.
   - Compare average spare part cost with resale value.
   - Calculate estimated profit margins for refurbished phones.

4. **Visualization**
   - Create charts for:
     - Price trends by brand/model.
     - Cost vs resale value.
     - Top phones by potential ROI.
   - Optionally build a dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Plotly Dash**.
